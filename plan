first idea - secret message

- input a word into the box
- send the word to the anagram site
- scrape the resulting anagrams
- put resulting anagrams (first 10? 20? hardest? tbd) into an array
- generate new site that displays resulting anagrams one at a time
  - there will also be a countdown indicator for the # of anagrams left until you get the secret message
- once the countdown timer ends, you get the secret message back

  structure

  m
    - scraper
  c
    - 
  v
    - / = put a word in the box
    - /fwafav = aka encoded stuff, retrieve the message



second idea - game

- select a difficulty level
- go to the play page where you see the first anagram and have an input box
- you have until the # of anagrams run out to put the answer in the box
